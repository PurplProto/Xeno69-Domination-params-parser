# Xeno69 Domination params parser

A quickly thrown together script for parsing Xeno's Domination misson parameters
into a markdown table.

## How to use

You'll need:
- Git (to clone this repo)
- At least Node.js v18
    - This has only been tested with v18.8.0
    - Node.js can be downloaded [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)

Steps:
1. Clone this repo
2. In your favourite terminal/console:
3. `cd Xeno69-Domination-params-parser`
4. `npm start`

The `npm start` command will clone Xeno's [domination](https://github.com/Xeno69/Domination) repo, then install the
required dependencies for this project to run. After that it will build this project and then execute the script.
This will result in a new markdown file being created in the current directory called `exported-params-table.md`.
Use your favourite markdown viewer to see it rendered in all it's glory ðŸ™‚.
